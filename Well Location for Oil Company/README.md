## Project Description

It is required to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where oil production will bring the most profit to the company. The analysis of possible profits and risks is performed using the **Bootstrap** technique.

## Skills and Tools

- **python**
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn** 
- **numpy**
- sklearn.model_selection.**train_test_split**
- sklearn.model_selection.**GridSearchCV**
- sklearn.preprocessing.**StandardScaler**
- sklearn.preprocessing.**MinMaxScaler**
- sklearn.pipeline.**Pipeline**
- sklearn.compose.**ColumnTransformer**
- sklearn.linear_model.**LinearRegression**
- sklearn.metrics.**root_mean_squared_error**
  sklearn.metrics.**make_scorer**


## General Conclusion

Based on the profit and risk estimates calculated by the Bootstrap technique for 1000 samples for each region, a specific region is recommended for development. A 95% confidence interval was determined.
