| #  | Project | Type | Skills | Description |
| -- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | [Predicting customer churn for a telecom operator](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20customer%20churn%20for%20a%20telecom%20operator) | ML | *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Sklearn, CatBoost, Phik, Shap*  | Capstone Project. The telecom operator wants to learn how to predict customer churn. If it turns out that the user is planning to leave, he will be offered promotional codes and special conditions.|
| 2  | [Determining the age of the buyer from a photograph](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/Determining%20the%20age%20of%20the%20buyer%20from%20a%20photograph) | CV | *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras*  | Building a model to determine the age of a buyer from a photograph |
| 3  | [Defining Comment Toxicity](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/Defining%20Comment%20Toxicity) | NLP | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, CatBoost, Spacy, Nltk, TF-IDF, Tdqm* | Training the model to classify comments into positive and negative (comment toxicity) |
| 4  | [Predicting taxi orders for the next hour (time series)](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/Defining%20Comment%20Toxicity) | ML | *Python, Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, CatBoost, Statsmodels* | Training a model to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour |
| 5  | [Well Location for Oil Company](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/Well%20Location%20for%20Oil%20Company) | ML | *Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Sklearn* | Building a machine learning model to help determine where oil production will bring the company the greatest profit. Based on the predictions of the created model, an analysis of profit and risk was performed using the *Bootstrap* technique |
| 6  | [DA for a Computer Game Store](https://github.com/allenbext/Portfolio/tree/main/DA%20for%20a%20Computer%20Game%20Store) | DA | *Python, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, SciPy, Missingno*  | Search for patterns that determine the success of games to identify potentially popular products and plan promotions. Hypothesis testing |
