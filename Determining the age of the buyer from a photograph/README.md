## Project Description

A chain supermarket is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. It is necessary to build a model that will determine a person's approximate age based on a photo. 

## Skills and Tools

- **python**
- **pandas** 
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.**ImageDataGenerator**
- tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet.**ResNet50**
- tensorflow.keras.models.**Sequential**
- tensorflow.keras.layers.**GlobalAveragePooling2D**
- tensorflow.keras.layers.**Dense**
- tensorflow.keras.optimizers.**Adam**
- tensorflow.**keras**

## General Conclusion

The trained model achieved the required MAE metric. There is no overfitting. The resulting model is recommended for use in recommending products for a specific age group.
